      "question": "The change in energy along the IRP is:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Energy increases on following the IRP from the TS to the minima",
        "b": "Energy can increase or decrease depending upon the geometry of the transition state",
        "c": "Energy decreases on following the IRP from the TS to the minima",
        "d": "Energy remains constant throughout the IRP path"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "c": "The transition state has the highest energy on the IRP path and the energy decreases on going towards the minima."

      "answers": {
        "a": "maximized",
        "b": "minimized",

      "answers": {
        "a": "Largest along the IRP and zero for the remaining 3N-6/3N-7 directions",

        "d": "Cannot be defined"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The gradient is largest along the IRP and zero along the remaining coordinates because at each point on the IRC, we minimize the potential energy along the remaining 3N-6/3N-7 directions."

        "d": "The IRP is followed until the gradient along the IRP becomes zero i.e. one has reached a stationary point on the PES."
