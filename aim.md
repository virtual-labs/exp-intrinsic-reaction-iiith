The path of a chemical reaction can be traced from the transition state (TS) to the products and/or reactants using the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) method. The method assumes that the starting geometry is a fair approximation of the TS.

The objective of this experiment is to perform IRC calculation using Gaussian and verify the reactants and products.
